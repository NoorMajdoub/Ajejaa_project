**Real-Time AI-Powered Route Optimization for Delivery and Field Service Vehicles**

## 🚀 Project Overview

SmartRoute AI is an intelligent assistant for transportation planning designed to reduce traffic contribution, fuel costs, and wasted time for companies operating delivery and service fleets.

This system leverages **real-time data**, **LLM reasoning**, and **driver-friendly notifications** to suggest **safe**, **fast**, and **place-aware** routes — all while adapting to changes mid-journey.

## 📌 Core Idea

A pipeline that collects multi-source data and feeds it into an LLM (or ML model) to generate optimal and adaptive routing suggestions. The system provides:

* Pre-trip route recommendations
* Real-time in-trip rerouting alerts (hands-free via TTS)

---

## 🔁 Pipeline Logic

1. **Data Collection**
   Gather data from:

   * 🚦 Real-time traffic APIs
   * ☁️ Weather APIs
   * 🧱 Road infrastructure rules
   * 🕓 Time of day / cultural norms
   * 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Social media signals (accidents, events)
   * 🧭 Custom business rules / location-specific info

2. **Input Structuring**
   Structure the above data into a context-rich prompt.

3. **Routing Intelligence**
   🔹 **LLM Task:**

   > “Given this context, what is the best route for a delivery van in downtown Tunis at 12:30 on Friday?”

   🔹 **Future ML Integration Ideas:**

   * Predict average ETA based on historical data
   * Classify streets by risk score (flood-prone, congested, etc.)

4. **Output Processing**

   * Parse the LLM response into structured data (JSON, etc.)
   * Extract route, explanation, and alternatives

5. **Driver Interaction**

   * 📱 Before trip: Check the app for the recommended route
   * 🚘 During trip: Get real-time alerts on route updates
   * 🔊 Alerts delivered via **text-to-speech (TTS)** to avoid distraction

## 🧠 Why This Matters

💸 **Reduce costs** for fuel & delay penalties
🛣️ **Reduce traffic impact** by choosing optimized routes
📦 **Improve delivery times** and SLA adherence
🧍‍♂️ **Assist drivers** with calm, adaptive guidance

---

## 🧪 Tech Stack (WIP)

* **APIs**: OpenWeatherMap, TomTom/HERE, Twitter/X (for incidents)
* **LLM**: GPT / Open-source LLMs via API
* **Frontend**: React Native or Flutter (driver app)
* **Backend**: FastAPI / Node.js
* **Database**: MongoDB / Firebase for storing delivery context
* **Text-to-Speech**: Google TTS / Coqui TTS for real-time alerts

---

## 🧭 Future Directions

* Train custom models for:

  * Risk-aware path planning
  * Road type classification using image data
  * Multi-agent delivery scheduling
* Integration with delivery CRM tools (FleetOps, etc.)

---

## 🤝 Target Users

* 🏢 **Delivery & logistics companies**
* 🧰 **Field service providers** (electricians, repair teams, etc.)
* 🚚 **Courier platforms** looking to optimize fleet movement
